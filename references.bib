   abstract = {Starting on May 25th of 2018 all EU countries began to apply the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This piece of legislation aims to protect and regulate data privacy and applies to any organization that holds or processes data on EU citizens, regardless of where it is headquartered. The penalties for non-compliance can be as high as 4\\% of global revenue for companies. As a result , compliance with GDPR is a must for companies who deal with users' data. The hallmark for data collection nowadays is Internet of Things devices. With sensors capturing every piece of information from the surrounding environment, concerns about privacy and data breaches have never been so vital. This paper introduces GDPR concepts and principles, analyses the challenges of data protection in IoT systems, discusses the privacy implications and potential issues, presents some mitigation approaches and draws conclusions and future steps.},

IoT is considered as a part of the Internet of the future and will comprise billions of intelligent communicating ‘things’. The future of the Internet will consist of heterogeneously connected devices that will further extend the borders of the world with physical entities and virtual components. The Internet of Things (IoT) will empower the connected things with new capabilities. In this survey, the definitions, architecture, fundamental technologies, and applications of IoT are systematically reviewed. Firstly, various definitions of IoT are introduced; secondly, emerging techniques for the implementation of IoT are discussed; thirdly, some open issues related to the IoT applications are explored; finally, the major challenges which need addressing by the research community and corresponding potential solutions are investigated.},

   abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices are increasingly found in everyday homes, providing useful functionality for devices such as TVs, smart speakers, and video doorbells. Along with their benefits come potential privacy risks, since these devices can communicate information about their users to other parties over the Internet. However, understanding these risks in depth and at scale is difficult due to heterogeneity in devices' user interfaces, protocols, and functionality. In this work, we conduct a multidimensional analysis of information exposure from 81 devices located in labs in the US and UK. Through a total of 34,586 rigorous automated and manual controlled experiments, we characterize information exposure in terms of destinations of Internet traffic, whether the contents of communication are protected by encryption, what are the IoT-device interactions that can be inferred from such content, and whether there are unexpected exposures of private and/or sensitive information (e.g., video surreptitiously transmitted by a recording device). We highlight regional differences between these results, potentially due to different privacy regulations in the US and UK. Last, we compare our controlled experiments with data gathered from an in situ user study comprising 36 participants.},

   abstract = {Despite the prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, there is little information about the purpose and risks of the Internet traffic these devices generate, and consumers have limited options for controlling those risks. A key open question is whether one can mitigate these risks by automatically blocking some of the Internet connections from IoT devices, without rendering the devices inoperable. In this paper, we address this question by developing a rigorous methodology that relies on automated IoT-device experimentation to reveal which network connections (and the information they expose) are essential, and which are not. We further develop strategies to automatically classify network traffic destinations as either required (i.e., their traffic is essential for devices to work properly) or not, hence allowing firewall rules to block traffic sent to non-required destinations without breaking the functionality of the device. We find that indeed 16 among the 31 devices we tested have at least one blockable non-required destination, with the maximum number of blockable destinations for a device being 11. We further analyze the destination of network traffic and find that all third parties observed in our experiments are blockable, while first and support parties are neither uniformly required or non-required. Finally, we demonstrate the limitations of existing blocklists on IoT traffic, propose a set of guidelines for automatically limiting non-essential IoT traffic, and we develop a prototype system that implements these guidelines.},

Although the security needs are well-recognized in this domain, it is still not fully understood how existing IP security protocols and architectures can be deployed. In this paper, we discuss the applicability and limitations of existing Inter-net protocols and security architectures in the context of the Internet of Things. First, we give an overview of the deployment model and general security needs. We then present challenges and requirements for IP-based security solutions and highlight specific technical limitations of standard IP security protocols.},

   abstract = {The Internet of Things paradigm envisions the pervasive interconnection and cooperation of smart things over the current and future Internet infrastructure. The Internet of Things is, thus, the evolution of the Internet to cover the real world, enabling many new services that will improve people's everyday lives, spawn new businesses, and make buildings, cities, and transport smarter. Smart things allow indeed for ubiquitous data collection or tracking, but these useful features are also examples of privacy threats that are already now limiting the success of the Internet of Things vision when not implemented correctly. These threats involve new challenges such as the pervasive privacy-aware management of personal data or methods to control or avoid ubiquitous tracking and profiling. This paper analyzes the privacy issues in the Internet of Things in detail. To this end, we first discuss the evolving features and trends in the Internet of Things with the goal of scrutinizing their privacy implications. Second, we classify and examine privacy threats in this new setting, pointing out the challenges that need to be overcome to ensure that the Internet of Things becomes a reality.},

In this scenario, the satisfaction of security and privacy requirements plays a fundamental role. Such requirements include data confidentiality and authentication, access control within the IoT network, privacy and trust among users and things, and the enforcement of security and privacy policies. Traditional security countermeasures cannot be directly applied to IoT technologies due to the different standards and communication stacks involved. Moreover, the high number of interconnected devices arises scalability issues; therefore a flexible infrastructure is needed able to deal with security threats in such a dynamic environment. In this survey we present the main research challenges and the existing solutions in the field of IoT security, identifying open issues, and suggesting some hints for future research.},

Billions of these computing devices are connected to the Internet to exchange data between themselves and/or their infrastructure. IoT promises to enable a plethora of smart services in almost every aspect of our daily interactions and improve the overall quality of life. However, with the increasing wide adoption of IoT, come significant privacy concerns to lose control of how our data is collected and shared with others. As such, privacy is a core requirement in any IoT ecosystem and is a major concern that inhibits its widespread user adoption. The ultimate source of user discomfort is the lack of control over personal raw data that is directly streamed from sensors to the outside world. In this survey, we review existing research and proposed solutions to rising privacy concerns from a multipoint of view to identify the risks and mitigations. First, we provide an evaluation of privacy issues and concerns in IoT systems due to resource constraints. Second, we describe the proposed IoT solutions that embrace a variety of privacy concerns such as identification, tracking, monitoring, and profiling. Lastly, we discuss the mechanisms and architectures for protecting IoT data in case of mobility at the device layer, infrastructure/platform layer, and application layer.},
