   abstract = {This paper presents a design and implementation of a data management platform to monitor and control smart objects in the Internet of Things (IoT). This is through IPv4/IPv6, and by combining IoT specific features and protocols such as CoAP, HTTP and WebSocket. The platform allows anomaly detection in IoT devices and real-time error reporting mechanisms. Moreover, the platform is designed as a standalone application, which targets at extending cloud connectivity to the edge of the network with fog computing. It extensively uses the features and entities provided by the Capillary Networks with a micro-services based architecture linked via a large set of REST APIs, which allows developing applications independently of the heterogeneous devices. The platform addresses the challenges in terms of connectivity, reliability, security and mobility of the Internet of Things through IPv6. The implementation of the platform is evaluated in a smart home scenario and tested via numeric results. The results show low latency, at the order of few ten of milliseconds, for building control over the implemented mobile application, which confirm realtime feature of the proposed solution.},

A smart city can monitor the physical world in real time, and provide intelligent services to both local residents and travelers in terms of transportation, healthcare, environment, entertainment, and energy. However, security and privacy concerns arise, since smart city applications not only collect a wide range of privacy-sensitive information from people and their social circles, but also control city facilities and influence people's lives. In this article, we investigate security and privacy in smart city applications. Specifically, we first introduce promising smart city applications and architecture. Then we discuss several security and privacy challenges in these applications. Some research efforts are subsequently presented to address these security and privacy challenges for intelligent healthcare, transportation, and smart energy. Finally, we point out some open issues for future research.},

However, they also opened the Pandora's box of cybercrime, stealing personal information and identity, spying on people's working and private lives as well as other related issues. Internet of Things (IoT) that combines a myriad of devices connected together for a two-way flow of information represents another important challenge , since it collects and stores zillions of personal data that can be abused by the third parties. Our paper analyses the recent developments of IoT in the light of data protection and tackling cybercrime. We show that since the concept is relatively young, very few legislative norms exist for its regulation and persecution of violators. It is also clear that new laws and rules should be introduced but the fragile balance between personal data protection and total "Big Brother-like" control from the law enforcement agencies and the governments should be carefully maintained and secured.},

   abstract = {Even though various commercial Smart City solutions are widely available on the market, we are still witnessing their rather limited adoption, where solutions are typically bound to specific verticals or remain in pilot stages. In this paper we argue that the lack of a Smart City regulatory framework is one of the major obstacles for a wider adoption of Smart City services in practice. Such framework should be accompanied by examples of good practice which stress the necessity of adopting interoperable Smart City services. Development and deployment of Smart City services can incur significant costs to cities, service providers and sensor manufacturers, and thus it is vital to adjust national legislation to ensure legal certainty to all stakeholders, and at the same time to protect interests of the citizens and the state. Additionally, due to a vast number of heterogeneous devices and Smart City services, both existing and future, their interoperability becomes vital for service replicability and massive deployment leading to digital transformation of future cities. The paper provides a classification of technical and regulatory characteristics of IoT services for Smart Cities which are mapped to corresponding roles in the IoT value chain. Four example use cases are chosen-Smart Parking, Smart Metering, Smart Street Lighting and Mobile Crowd Sensing-to showcase the legal implications relevant to each service. Based on the analysis, we propose a set of recommendations for each role in the value chain related to regulatory requirements of the aforementioned Smart City services. The analysis and recommendations serve as examples of good practice in hope that they will facilitate a wider adoption and longevity of IoT-based Smart City services.},

Along with their benefits come potential privacy risks, since these devices can communicate information about their users to other parties over the Internet. However, understanding these risks in depth and at scale is difficult due to heterogeneity in devices' user interfaces, protocols, and functionality. In this work, we conduct a multidimensional analysis of information exposure from 81 devices located in labs in the US and UK. Through a total of 34,586 rigorous automated and manual controlled experiments, we characterize information exposure in terms of destinations of Internet traffic, whether the contents of communication are protected by encryption, what are the IoT-device interactions that can be inferred from such content, and whether there are unexpected exposures of private and/or sensitive information (e.g., video surreptitiously transmitted by a recording device). We highlight regional differences between these results, potentially due to different privacy regulations in the US and UK. Last, we compare our controlled experiments with data gathered from an in situ user study comprising 36 participants.},

A key open question is whether one can mitigate these risks by automatically blocking some of the Internet connections from IoT devices, without rendering the devices inoperable. In this paper, we address this question by developing a rigorous methodology that relies on automated IoT-device experimentation to reveal which network connections (and the information they expose) are essential, and which are not. We further develop strategies to automatically classify network traffic destinations as either required (i.e., their traffic is essential for devices to work properly) or not, hence allowing firewall rules to block traffic sent to non-required destinations without breaking the functionality of the device. We find that indeed 16 among the 31 devices we tested have at least one blockable non-required destination, with the maximum number of blockable destinations for a device being 11. We further analyze the destination of network traffic and find that all third parties observed in our experiments are blockable, while first and support parties are neither uniformly required or non-required. Finally, we demonstrate the limitations of existing blocklists on IoT traffic, propose a set of guidelines for automatically limiting non-essential IoT traffic, and we develop a prototype system that implements these guidelines.},
