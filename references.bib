   abstract = {With the flourishing and advancement of the IoT, the smart city has become an emerging paradigm, consisting of ubiquitous sensing, heterogeneous network infrastructure, and intelligent information processing and control systems. A smart city can monitor the physical world in real time, and provide intelligent services to both local residents and travelers in terms of transportation, healthcare, environment, entertainment, and energy. However, security and privacy concerns arise, since smart city applications not only collect a wide range of privacy-sensitive information from people and their social circles, but also control city facilities and influence people's lives. In this article, we investigate security and privacy in smart city applications. Specifically, we first introduce promising smart city applications and architecture. Then we discuss several security and privacy challenges in these applications. Some research efforts are subsequently presented to address these security and privacy challenges for intelligent healthcare, transportation, and smart energy. Finally, we point out some open issues for future research.},

	abstract = {Starting on May 25th of 2018 all EU countries began to apply the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This piece of legislation aims to protect and regulate data privacy and applies to any organization that holds or processes data on EU citizens, regardless of where it is headquartered. The penalties for non-compliance can be as high as 4\% of global revenue for companies. As a result , compliance with GDPR is a must for companies who deal with users' data. The hallmark for data collection nowadays is Internet of Things devices. With sensors capturing every piece of information from the surrounding environment, concerns about privacy and data breaches have never been so vital. This paper introduces GDPR concepts and principles, analyses the challenges of data protection in IoT systems, discusses the privacy implications and potential issues, presents some mitigation approaches and draws conclusions and future steps.},

   abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices are increasingly found in everyday homes, providing useful functionality for devices such as TVs, smart speakers, and video doorbells. Along with their benefits come potential privacy risks, since these devices can communicate information about their users to other parties over the Internet. However, understanding these risks in depth and at scale is difficult due to heterogeneity in devices' user interfaces, protocols, and functionality. In this work, we conduct a multidimensional analysis of information exposure from 81 devices located in labs in the US and UK. Through a total of 34,586 rigorous automated and manual controlled experiments, we characterize information exposure in terms of destinations of Internet traffic, whether the contents of communication are protected by encryption, what are the IoT-device interactions that can be inferred from such content, and whether there are unexpected exposures of private and/or sensitive information (e.g., video surreptitiously transmitted by a recording device). We highlight regional differences between these results, potentially due to different privacy regulations in the US and UK. Last, we compare our controlled experiments with data gathered from an in situ user study comprising 36 participants.},

   abstract = {Despite the prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, there is little information about the purpose and risks of the Internet traffic these devices generate, and consumers have limited options for controlling those risks. A key open question is whether one can mitigate these risks by automatically blocking some of the Internet connections from IoT devices, without rendering the devices inoperable. In this paper, we address this question by developing a rigorous methodology that relies on automated IoT-device experimentation to reveal which network connections (and the information they expose) are essential, and which are not. We further develop strategies to automatically classify network traffic destinations as either required (i.e., their traffic is essential for devices to work properly) or not, hence allowing firewall rules to block traffic sent to non-required destinations without breaking the functionality of the device. We find that indeed 16 among the 31 devices we tested have at least one blockable non-required destination, with the maximum number of blockable destinations for a device being 11. We further analyze the destination of network traffic and find that all third parties observed in our experiments are blockable, while first and support parties are neither uniformly required or non-required. Finally, we demonstrate the limitations of existing blocklists on IoT traffic, propose a set of guidelines for automatically limiting non-essential IoT traffic, and we develop a prototype system that implements these guidelines.},

Current trends and initiatives, such as 'Industrie 4.0' and Internet of Things (IoT), promise innovative business models and novel user experiences through strong connectivity and effective use of next generation of embedded devices. These systems generate, process, and exchange vast amounts of security-critical and privacy-sensitive data, which makes them attractive targets of attacks. Cyberattacks on IoT systems are very critical since they may cause physical damage and even threaten human lives. The complexity of these systems and the potential impact of cyberattacks bring upon new threats. This paper gives an introduction to Industrial IoT systems, the related security and privacy challenges, and an outlook on possible solutions towards a holistic security framework for Industrial IoT systems.},

   abstract = {<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of Internet-enabled devices that can sense, communicate, and react to changes in their environment. Billions of these computing devices are connected to the Internet to exchange data between themselves and/or their infrastructure. IoT promises to enable a plethora of smart services in almost every aspect of our daily interactions and improve the overall quality of life. However, with the increasing wide adoption of IoT, come significant privacy concerns to lose control of how our data is collected and shared with others. As such, privacy is a core requirement in any IoT ecosystem and is a major concern that inhibits its widespread user adoption. The ultimate source of user discomfort is the lack of control over personal raw data that is directly streamed from sensors to the outside world. In this survey, we review existing research and proposed solutions to rising privacy concerns from a multipoint of view to identify the risks and mitigations. First, we provide an evaluation of privacy issues and concerns in IoT systems due to resource constraints. Second, we describe the proposed IoT solutions that embrace a variety of privacy concerns such as identification, tracking, monitoring, and profiling. Lastly, we discuss the mechanisms and architectures for protecting IoT data in case of mobility at the device layer, infrastructure/platform layer, and application layer.</p>},
